For technology recommendations for submitting proposals, there are several options:

1. **GitHub/GitLab:** These platforms provide a straightforward and widely used way to manage proposal submissions through repositories and version control. You can use the repository's issue tracker to submit ideas and engage in discussions.

2. **DAO-Specific Platforms:** Some DAOs have dedicated platforms or forums for proposal submissions and discussions. Examples include Aragon, DAOstack, and Moloch DAO.

3. **Discord or Telegram:** Many DAOs maintain active communities on messaging platforms like Discord or Telegram. You can submit your ideas in the respective channels or groups dedicated to proposal discussions.

4. **DAO-Specific Forums:** Some DAOs set up their forums for discussions and proposal submissions. Discourse is a popular platform for this purpose.

5. **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** For decentralized storage and retrieval, you can use IPFS to host your proposal document and share the content through a hash.

The technology choice largely depends on the preferences and existing infrastructure of the DAO you are submitting the idea to. It's essential to check the DAO's guidelines or ask the community for the preferred platform for proposal submissions.
