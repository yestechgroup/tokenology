### Different means of distribution

The common token distribution methods are:

| Founders' reward  | A portion of tokens that are reserved for the founders of the DAO or other early contributors.                                                                          |
| Staking           | A process of locking up tokens in order to participate in the DAO's governance or earn rewards.                                                                         |

## Can we do better?

Novel methods suitable for an iwi to distribute tokens:

### Cultural Engagement Rewards

Tokens could be distributed to members who actively participate in cultural preservation efforts, traditional knowledge sharing, and contributions to Maori arts, language, and heritage.

### Marae-Based Distribution

Utilizing marae (community meeting grounds) as distribution centers, tokens could be distributed during significant cultural events, reinforcing tribal unity and participation.


### Knowledge Sharing Contributions

Tokens could be rewarded to members who share educational content related to Maori culture, history, and traditions on DAO-sponsored platforms or websites.

### Elders' Allocation

A portion of tokens could be reserved for elder members of the tribe, recognizing their wisdom and contributions to the community.

### Kaitiaki / Resource Stewardship Rewards

Tokens could be allocated to members involved in sustainable practices, environmental protection, and land conservation efforts in alignment with Maori values of kaitiakitanga (guardianship).

### Language Revitalization Incentives

Members who actively contribute to the preservation and revitalization of the Maori language could be rewarded with tokens.

### Cultural Ambassador Program

Introduce a program where members who act as cultural ambassadors, promoting Maori culture and values to external communities, receive tokens as a recognition of their efforts.

When implementing token distribution methods, it is crucial to ensure cultural sensitivity, transparency, and community engagement. Token allocation should align with the iwi values, promote community involvement, and foster a sense of ownership and responsibility among members. The distribution process should involve extensive consultation with tribal leaders, elders, and the broader community to ensure inclusivity and appropriateness.
