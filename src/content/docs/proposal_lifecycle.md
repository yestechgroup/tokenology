Proposal Workflows
Draft Workflow for DAO Proposal Process:




1. Idea Submission:
Any member of the DAO can submit an idea for improvement or change.
The idea is typically submitted through an online platform or forum dedicated to DAO discussions.

2. Initial Review and Discussion:
Upon submission, the idea goes through an initial review phase to check for relevance and feasibility.
DAO members can participate in discussions and provide feedback to refine the idea further.
During this phase, the proposer can gather support and build a team to work on the proposal.

3. Formal Proposal Creation:
   - Once the idea is well-defined and refined, the proposer creates a formal proposal document.
   - The document outlines the problem statement, proposed solution, implementation details, and expected outcomes.
   - This proposal should include measurable metrics to assess the success of the implementation.

4. Proposal Review:
   - The proposal undergoes a thorough review by other DAO members or designated reviewers.
   - Reviewers evaluate the proposal's alignment with the DAO's mission, technical feasibility, and potential risks.
   - Feedback and suggestions are given to the proposer for further improvement.

5. Community Discussion and Refinement:
   - The proposal is open for community-wide discussion and feedback.
   - Suggestions for improvement are encouraged, and the proposer can make necessary adjustments.

6. Formal Voting:
   - After a reasonable discussion period, the proposal enters the voting phase.
   - DAO members cast their votes to approve or reject the proposal.
   - The voting process can be based on token-weighted voting or other mechanisms for fairness.

7. Implementation and Measurement:
   - If the proposal is approved, the proposer and their team begin the implementation process.
   - Throughout the implementation, progress updates are shared with the DAO community.
   - The proposal should include specific key performance indicators (KPIs) or metrics to measure its success.

8. Assessment and Iteration:
   - After the proposal's implementation, the DAO regularly evaluates its impact using the defined metrics.
   - DAO members discuss and analyze the results to determine if the proposal achieved its intended objectives.
   - Based on the assessment, the proposal may undergo further iterations for improvement.

9. Proposal Archive:
   - Completed proposals, along with their outcomes, are archived for transparency and future reference.
   - This archive helps new proposers to avoid duplicating ideas and provides valuable insights for future improvements.

Note: The above workflow is a general guideline for implementing a proposal process within a DAO. The actual process might vary depending on the specific DAO's governance structure, technology stack, and community preferences.
